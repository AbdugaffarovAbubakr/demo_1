Question 19
A developer is building a Node and Express application and wants to improve code structure, manage database interactions cleanly, and ensure security. Based on best practices, which set of actions would best support these goals?



Use a monolithic file structure, connect directly to the database with raw SQL, and rely solely on console logs for security



Focus only on frontend design, as backend structure and security aren’t necessary for Node applications



Apply the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern for organization, use ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) libraries such as Mongoose or Sequelize, and implement input validation and authentication mechanisms



Build the app without separation of concerns, avoid third-party tools, and expose database credentials directly in the source code

Question 20
A development team is designing a Node.js application expected to serve millions of users globally. They want to ensure fast response times, prevent overloading any single server, and keep the service running even during partial failures. Based on best practices discussed in the video, which combination of strategies would best support their goal?



Apply sticky sessions using hard-coded IPs, skip failure detection to reduce complexity, and rely on browser-based caching for session recovery



Configure Nginx as a reverse proxy with session persistence, deploy multiple Node instances with the cluster module, and use Redis for distributed session caching



Use round-robin DNS, log errors using console.log, and run a single server instance for simplicity



Build the application using monolithic architecture, avoid using any load balancer, and rely on Node’s non-blocking I/O alone for performance
